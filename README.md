# Nexus

A multi-agent coding tool with a unified chat UI. Nexus spawns CLI subprocesses (Claude CLI, Gemini CLI) against a local project directory, letting you run real-time streaming conversations with multiple AI agents side by side.

Create custom agent profiles with distinct names, icons, colors, and personality system prompts. Use @mentions to route messages to specific agents within a thread.
