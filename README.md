# Entourage

A multi-agent coding tool with a unified chat UI. Entourage spawns CLI subprocesses (Claude CLI, Gemini CLI, Codex CLI, OpenCode) against a local project directory, letting you run real-time streaming conversations with multiple AI agents side by side.

Create custom agent profiles with distinct names, icons, colors, and personality system prompts. Use @mentions to route messages to specific agents within a thread.

## Features

### Multi-agent chat with @mentions

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- At least one supported agent CLI installed

### Supported Agent CLIs

Entourage ships with four built-in agent backends. Install any one of them to get started, or install multiple and use them side by side in the same workspace.

- [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) uses the `claude` command:
  `npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code`
- [Gemini CLI](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli) uses the `gemini` command:
  `npm install -g @google/gemini-cli`
- [Codex CLI](https://developers.openai.com/codex/cli) uses the `codex` command:
  `npm install -g @openai/codex`
- [OpenCode](https://opencode.ai/docs/) uses the `opencode` command:
  `npm install -g opencode-ai`

After installing a CLI, run its command once to verify it is available on your `PATH` and complete authentication:

```bash
claude
gemini
codex
opencode auth login
```

See each project's docs for alternative installers such as native binaries or Homebrew.

### Run with npx

Run Entourage directly from npm without cloning the repo:

```bash
cd ~/my-project
npx @fadilf/entourage@latest
```

On first run, Entourage builds the app locally, then starts the `entourage` command on port `5555`.

Open [http://localhost:5555](http://localhost:5555) to start chatting.

You can pass CLI flags through `npx` the same way:

```bash
npx @fadilf/entourage@latest --help
npx @fadilf/entourage@latest -p 8080
```

#### CLI Options

| Flag | Description | Default |
|------|-------------|---------|
| `--port`, `-p` | Port to serve on | `5555` |
| `--host`, `-H` | Host to bind to | `localhost` |

```bash
npx @fadilf/entourage@latest -p 8080              # custom port
npx @fadilf/entourage@latest -H 0.0.0.0           # expose to network
npx @fadilf/entourage@latest -H 0.0.0.0 -p 8080  # both
```

### Remote Access with Tailscale

Run Entourage on your laptop or a VPS, then pick up where you left off from your phone, tablet, or any other device. With `-H 0.0.0.0`, you can reach it remotely over your [Tailscale](https://tailscale.com/) tailnet without putting it on the public internet.

Enable [Tailscale Funnel](https://tailscale.com/kb/1223/funnel) to expose it through a public HTTPS URL. Since Entourage includes a web app manifest and installable PWA support, opening that URL on your phone lets you install it as a standalone app.

### Install Globally

If you want a persistent shell command instead of invoking Entourage through `npx` each time:

```bash
npm install -g @fadilf/entourage
entourage
```

### Local Development

Clone the repo if you want to work on Entourage itself:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```
